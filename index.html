                    For startups and venture capital firms considering a digital product development project, developing
                    an
                    expert speed to market strategy is of paramount importance. This is the case, and it should be. <a
                        class="font-bold text-[#1a73e8]" href="">
                        In
                        light of the fact that 48.4% of failed startups reported that they had run out
                        of funding in 2022</a>,it would be reasonable to focus on time-to-profitability.

                    <span class="lg:block lg:mb-[20px]"></span> is no doubt that lack of financing is the number one
                    killer of startups, but it is
                    important
                    to
                    note
                    that 25.5% of failed startups attributed their failure to the lack of a business plan, while 22.8%
                    attributed it to the absence of the right team. A poor user experience, a lack of market need, and a
                    loss of
                    focus are also among the most significant reasons why startups fail.

                    Startups face many challenges as they develop their go-to-market strategies. How can growth-focused
                    leaders
                    ensure that their products are of the highest quality while optimizing the speed of their
                    go-to-market?

                    The stance of our company is that product leaders should not have to choose between speed and
                    quality. When
                    the right team is assembled, product leaders can adhere to the original concept while facilitating
                    rapid
                    product development. Using a three-pronged approach, we have enabled startups to succeed: speed,
                    expertise,
                    and leadership: a delicate trifecta often overlooked by in-house teams.

                    Lack of resources and limited experience in new product development often cause internal teams to
                    have
                    difficulty scaling products effectively. Startups should work with business experts who know their
                    technology and skilled technologists who understand their industry to ensure they do not sacrifice
                    product-market fit for speedy development. A missing connection between technology and business
                    intelligence
                    is often the catalyst for common startup missteps to occur.

                <article class="article mt-[15px] mx-6 mb-4 font-manrope text-base text-left a4 lg:mr-[133px] lg:ml-[166px]">Our approach to rapid product development is fundamentally the same as
                    our approach to all other projects. It begins with strategy, continues with product design &
                    development,
                    and culminates with quality assurance and long-term maintenance (which we call "Sustain").
                    <span class="lg:block lg:mb-[20px]"></span>
                    When we are concerned with speed to market, however, we take special care to consider the size and
                    composition of the team. The proper allocation of resources and the selection of talent with the
                    necessary
                    expertise are essential for a quick and efficient build. Moreover, we place a great deal of focus on
                    early
                    planning and milestone achievement, in order to ensure the team works cohesively as a whole (as
                    opposed to
                    one feature holding up the remainder of the project).

                    Ultimately, the definition of "rapid" will depend on the product and the needs of the client. A
                    couple of
                    months may be considered rapid for a single mobile application. It may take several months to a year
                    for a
                    full-fledged digital platform that combines web and mobile technologies. We have launched products
                    in as
                    little as six months for startups with tight deadlines, but it's all relative. That is why our team
                    places a
                    great deal of emphasis on understanding business needs before writing a single line of code.

                    Two major factors will affect the price of your project: the size of your team and the scope of your
                    project. The larger the team, the faster the project consumes resources - not to mention the cost of
                    finding, vetting, hiring, and onboarding individual talent with the right technological and industry
                    expertise in silos. (This is why we use consistent teams with years of experience working together.)
                    Scope
                    is equally important - a more robust 1.0 will require a larger investment prior to launch.
                    Endeavor's
                    product teams are experts at determining which tools are essential to a successful version 1.0 and
                    which
                    features can be postponed until later, to help our customers maximize their investment.

                    Strategy is the difference between a software expert and a product expert. As part of our commitment
                    to your
                    business needs and KPIs, we engage your team from Day 1 to ensure that our efforts are aligned with
                    your
                    goals. Our team also relies heavily on co-design methods in order to facilitate internal buy-in to
                    gain a
                    comprehensive understanding of your needs.

                    A rapid product build also leaves a much narrower window for addressing issues that might arise. An
                    unexpected setback may not seem significant on a two-year project, but when you are trying to launch
                    a
                    product within six months, it can have a significant impact. We place a great deal of emphasis on
                    accounting
                    for any risks and challenges before a project begins.

                    <h2>Determine the feasibility of a speed-to-market build</h2>
                    The feasibility of building your product in the time allocated is another prime consideration before
                    embarking on a rapid product development effort. Almost always, it is better to rethink, delay, or
                    terminate
                    a product than to rush it out the door and see it fail. In a software development project, the
                    Endeavor team
                    applied lean methodologies in order to assist the company in determining whether building specific
                    functions
                    would be of value to their customers. We worked closely with their team to distinguish nice-to-haves
                    from
                    need-to-haves by using rapid prototyping to test the overall product hypothesis, and ultimately
                    determined
                    the feature was not the right fit for user needs. This decision enabled Fundwise to save 77% of its
                    budgeted
                    amount.

                    Endeavor prides itself on being a strong strategic partner to our customers and a good steward of
                    their
                    resources. While scrapping a project or undertaking a major rework is always a difficult decision,
                    it is
                    preferable to the alternative. Ensure that you do not hire an inexperienced team that might misuse
                    company
                    resources and time. Without a team with a strong background in rapid product development, you risk
                    unnecessarily high burn rates and overall underperformance. A successful track record of product
                    launches
                    proves that partnering with a ready-made, cross-functional product development team is the ideal
